# Student-Grade-Prediction
### This is a machine learning project that predicts the grade of a student

## Objective
Prediction of the final grade of high school students

## Problem Statement
The problem statement can be defined as follows ”Given a dataset containing attribute of 396 students where using the features available from dataset and define classification algorithms to identify whether the student performs good in final grade exam, also to evaluate different machine learning models on the dataset.”


## Attribute Information:
* school - student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)
* sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male)
* age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)
* address - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural)
* famsize - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3)
* Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart)
* Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - “ 5th to 9th grade, 3 - “ secondary education or 4 - “ higher education)
* Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - “ 5th to 9th grade, 3 - “ secondary education or 4 - “ higher education)
* Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other')
* Fjob - father's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other')
* reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other')
* guardian - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other')
* traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour)
* studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours)
* failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)
* schoolsup - extra educational support (binary: yes or no)
* famsup - family educational support (binary: yes or no)
* paid - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no)

* goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
* Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
* Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
* health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good)
* absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)

# Methodology

There is a great need to develop an appropriate solution to assist students retention at higher education institutions. Early grade prediction is one of the solutions that have a tendency to monitor students’ progress in the degree courses at the University and will lead to improving the students’ learning process based on predicted grades.

Different models can be developed to predict students’ grades in the enrolled courses, which provide valuable information to facilitate students’ retention in those courses. This information can be used to early identify students at-risk based on which a system can suggest the instructors to provide special attention to those students.

Using various packages such as seaborn & matplotlib to represent the data along with different attributes graphically or pictorially to analyse the dataset for predicting the Final Grade(G3).

## Machine Learning Algorithms used
1. Linear Regression
2. SVM
3. Random Forest
